# tcrtools
functions for parsing, formatting, &amp; visualizing outputs from clonotype identification software

These are mostly just useful functions I've written to make my own life easier when working with outputs from IMGT HighV-QUEST or MiXCR. I might try to formalize stuff into more of a package at some point, but a lot of the features end up being redundant with [`tcR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcR/index.html).
